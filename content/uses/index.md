## Development
I primarily develop in Java and Kotlin for the backend. I like Vue for frontend but I am proficient enough to deliver rapidly in React as well.
I have been dabbling on Golang recently and while not fully proficient, I love developing in it and will probably be my language of choice soon.

- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - is my main IDE with Jetbrains Mono font. I stick to the default Darcula theme at night and Cyan Light during the day.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) - is my terminal replacement, but I barely use 25% of its features. I run it with Oh My Zsh! and [Powerlevel 10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for hosting my sideproject and this site is served through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
